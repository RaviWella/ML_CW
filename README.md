# Income Prediction Syatem

Introduction:

Welcome to the Income Prediction System repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system capable of predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Leveraging data from the UCI Machine Learning repository ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult ). 
The system employs two popular classification algorithms, 

- Naive Bayes 

- Random Forest 

to model and predict income levels.

The repository contains code, datasets, and documentation detailing the steps involved in building and evaluating the predictive models. By exploring this repository, you can gain insights into the data preprocessing techniques, model implementation, evaluation metrics, and experimental results obtained from the predictive models.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a machine learning practitioner, or someone interested in income prediction tasks, this repository provides a valuable resource for understanding and implementing predictive modeling techniques in Python.

Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and documentation to learn more about the Income Prediction System and its performance in predicting income levels based on census data. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome!

Let's embark on the journey of predicting incomes and uncovering valuable insights from census data together. Happy exploring!
